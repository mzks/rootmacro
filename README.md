# rootmacro

This repository is useful ROOT (by CERN)  macros which are including data fill, making .root files to make TTree files.
One is including simple Makefile too. 
Users only have to do three steps, moving data to this directory, change setting adopting the data, and 'make'.

Default TTree name is 'tr'.
